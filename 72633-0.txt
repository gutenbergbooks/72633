  Send me by Santa Claus one single smile
  And help me make it Christmas all the while.

  I just can’t see, to tell you true,
  How they spelt Christmas without a “You.”
  For, as for me, there is no doubt
  It wouldn’t be Christmas with “You” left out!

A New Year’s Wish.

  May the only shadows that you see before you
  Be those caused by the sun of fortune shining
  Upon your back, and your only tears those of
  Joy and laughter.

  May every hour of Christmas Day
  Strew life’s best gifts along your way.
  And when the New Year comes, why then
  May the supply begin again!

  The golden argosy of my affection
  Is sailing to you over the seas of life,
  And waits but the Christmas-tide to
  Float it to the harbor of your heart!

  If you would set my heart aglow
  Come stand beneath my mistletoe—
  I’ll show you there with all my powers
  How bees sip honey from the flowers!

  The air is not vast enough to carry my
  Wireless wishes of joy to you, so take this
  Card as a simple statement of your balance
  Of love in the Bank of my Heart!

  The best of crafts for the Christmas-tide
  Is a friend-ship that will sure abide
  The storm and stress of life’s troubled sea—
  Such is the craft that I send to thee!
